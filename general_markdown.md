#Markdown syntax

##Introduction

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a simple markup language with the original goal "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)‚Äù.
However, since then markdown got integrated into many tools and websites to easily write text that after processing gets nice formatting. It is an easy way to write nicely structured documents that can be converted to other formats like HTML, Latex, mediawiki, docx, rst, and many more using  e.g   a general purpose document converter like [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html).

Note! These web-pages are written completely in Markdown and on-the-fly converted to HTML via [MDwiki](http://www.mdwiki.info/).
